# s3-chat

This application is meant to be a clone of t3.chat as more of an academic project than anything else mostly.
The stuff in here is for expanding my own knowledge through doing.


## TO-DO

### current limitation
[] Colors and stuff(make it aesthetic and nice and professional).
[] Make sure not to hit random free tier rate limits(current bottleneck causing 429 errors).
[x] markdown format rendering and syntax highlighting.

[x] Auth for logging in, multi user chats, no chat exposed to someone else.
[x] Store chats (have history of call previous chats).
[] Choose between multiple LLM providers (free tier api keys of openrouter and other places).
[] Have an about me page, rate limits.
[yeah right] Integrate payments(??)
[x] Title generation
